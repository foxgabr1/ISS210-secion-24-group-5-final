                <div class="container"><p>Gender discrimination still painfully exists in our workplaces today and often goes completely unoticed. This issue needs to be brought to the attention of everybody because it affects so many, making it harder for them to live their day to day lives. Worst of all, those who are affected often feel they cannot bring these issues to light because they fear any repercussions that might come from them saying something. It is especially painful for those affected by gender discrimination in the workplace because it is all too common that we hear that this problem simply “does not exist” or “does not exist anymore.” This problem is very real and even if you do not feel its effects, someone else around you might be suffering in silence. It is about time we face the facts and acknowledge the problem of gender discrimination in the workplace.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4"><br>The authors of <em>Academic Medicine</em> focused on gender equality in the workplace in the section <q>Achieving Gender and Social Equality: More Than Gender Parity Is Needed</q>. When writing this article the authors reviewed AAMC data on gender parity and intersectionality. In this particular section they focused on 6 main effects and causes of gender inequality in the workplace, particularly in the medical field. Two of these emphasized topics that stood out were <q>Gender Parity Does Not Equal Gender Equality</q> and <q>Sexual Harassment in the workplace is expected</q>. In the first section the authors dove into the idea of equal representation of men and women in the workplace. They found that women are mostly found in the lower ranked, and paid, positions. They also discovered that <q>...even in cases of equal work and position (same rank, training, and experience), unequal pay continues to disadvantage women despite evidence that the quality of care women provide is equivalent and in some cases superior to that of their male colleagues</q>(<em>Achieving Gender and Social Equality:More Than Gender Parity Is Needed</em>, 10.1097/ACM.0000000000002877). In the second topic the authors evaluated the statistics and effects of sexual harasment that individuals face in the workplace. They came to the conclusion that gender norms dictated by society contribute heavily to the casual harassment women face at their jobs. Harassment is such a common practice in workplaces all over the United States that it is expected, data indicates that <q>Among medical school faculty early in their careers, 30% of women compared with 4% of men reported being harassed in the workplace; women who reported harassment also stated that it affected their confidence and/or hampered their careers</q>(<em>Achieving Gender and Social Equality:More Than Gender Parity Is Needed</em>, 10.1097/ACM.0000000000002877). While these sections leave a feeling of defeat the authors believe that with hard work and cooperation gender inequality can slowly be fixed. They suggest that we not only improve gendeer parity but also attack the root of the issue, the built in norms and bias that lead to gender discrimination. This can be achieved by creating programs and training strategies that help individuals identify and overcome biases. On top of creating those programs, hiring more women into senior leadership positions helps improve the visibility of women. Overall, despite the equal number of men and women in the medical field we require critical changes to the culture of the workplace in order to achieve gender and social equality.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">This video explains how there are many forms of sexism that can be seen in the workplace. The speaker expands on the idea of microaggressions toward women when working and how that subtle discrimination affects women. She mentions her own personal experience of watching a colloquium and realizing the majority of speaker’s were male. She shows how there are many people who would not notice this form of subtle sexism since it has been normalized. This video emphasizes the idea that sexism can be very subtle in the workplace and still have massive affects on women. It also explains the problem that even when a women is experiencing discrimination, she may not speak out about it since she may not want to seem dramatic and does not have enough evidence due to the aggressions being smaller instances. There are many women who may not know they are experiencing sexism because the issues they are dealing with have been normalized for women.

It takes various looks on how individuals ciew many rhings in different lights which make it very difficult to handle in a fast and appropriate way. One quote from the article that really helps drive this idea is “Clair (1993), for example, argues that women may account for their experiences without labelling them or orienting to them as instances of sexual harassment, due to the constraining influence of patriarchy.” Through this article we see just how imporatant it is to think critically and carefully as we move through such issues.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Although women have taken over many positions of power in workplaces and what were once male-dominated fields are slowly turning to female-dominated, there are still countless sexist experiences that most if not all women will face in their careers. Even though comments to someone may not be straightforward and direct, women often deal with microaggressions and being ignored in the workplace. In fields such as engineering, business, science, and many more, women are seen as less valuable and less intelligent than men. In the article “Rendering sexism invisible in the workplace. A narrative analysis of female entrepreneurs’ stories of not being talked to by men” by Karen Jones and Jonathan Clifton, a woman named Sally is interviewed about her experience in her IT career. She says that “there are still loads of blokes out there that still think I’m not in charge” and that they'll come to her  when they are not getting the response they want from the other men. She is seen as not the first person that someone would go to, but as a person who they can go to when they want their way. Often, women are seen as weak and not willing to stand their ground, like Sally is at her job. People think that they can convince a woman to do something for them much easier than they could a man. The lack of women in power being seen as powerful has a large effect on everyone involved. Women are invalidated continuously in the work place simply because of their sex.

                                    <p class="mb-4">Women are commonly the most discriminated against in the workplace. Women face this discrimination in many ways such as not being paid the same amount as men and not being treated with equality. This source explains how research and multiple experiments were conducted and showed how the discrimination that many women face in the workplace results in cases of anxiety and depression. A few quotes from this source that stuck out were, “In Study 1, performed with 179 Italian adult women (Mage = 24.17, SD = 9.45), exposure to a hostile sexist message and to a benevolent sexist message fostered participants’ anxiety and depression”, “The effects on anxiety and depression of exposure to a hostile sexist message were stronger among participants with low versus individual levels of hostile sexism”, and “Analogously, the effects of exposure to a benevolent sexist message were stronger among participants with low versus individual levels of benevolent sexism.” More often than not, women are seen as weaker as well as being in need of a man. Overall, women do not receive the fair treatment they are intended to have from others in the workplace and it is crucial to understand the dynamics of these issues in the workplace today.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">HR is a system of organizational practices aimed at managing employees and ensuring that they are accomplishing organizational goals. The article states that, "HR systems can range from those that are well structured and supported by an entire department, led by HR specialists, to haphazard sets of policies and procedures enacted by managers and supervisors without formal training". This means that towards the less formal HR policies, there can lie a lot of discrimination, especially towards women. This is because these policies determine access employees have to certian benefits and treatment. "Human resource policies that are inherently biased against a group of people, regardless of their job-related knowledge, skills, abilities, and performance can be termed institutional discrimination. Institutional discrimination against women can occur in each type of HR policy from the recruitment and selection of an individual into an organization, through his/her role assignments, training, pay, performance evaluations, promotion, and termination". This means that women can be discriminated against in the workplace by deducting pay, limiting promotion, and other types of things, all through these HR poicies institutional discrimination. An example of this from the article would be, "In organizations with more formal job ladders that are used to dictate and constrain workers’ promotion opportunities, women are less likely to advance". Studies with varying methodologies also show that women face personal discrimination when going through the selection process for these positions.</p>
